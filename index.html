<h1>Welcome to SJFisher.com</h1>
<p>I will use this site to learn about web analytics and to document my URL redirect SaaS service</p>
  
<p>My time limited URL redirect service is available at https://url.sjfisher.com</p>
  
<p>To use this service you first need to request an API key which can be done as follows:</p>
<code>
   curl -d '{"email": "your-valid-email-address" }' https://url.sjfisher.com/getkey
</code>
<p> This returns: 
  Record created
{"key": " key-value " }
  {"Notice": "Please check for email and activate before using the key" } </p>
<p>Then you will receive an email that you need to click on the link in order to activate the returned API key</p>
<p>To create a short URL you need to do the following:</p>
<code>
    curl -d '{"Shorturl": "your-short-id", "From": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+00:00", "Longurl": "the-target-url", "To": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+00:00", "Defaulturl": "default-url"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Api-Key: your-api-key" -v -X POST https://url.sjfisher.com
</code>
<p>example:</p>
<code>
      curl -d '{"Shorturl": "steve", "From": "2020-12-31T00:00:00+00:00", "Longurl": "http://topgear.com", "To": "2021-12-31T00:00:00+00:00", "Defaulturl": "http://google.com"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Api-Key: blkkuyjewpxr" -v -X POST https://url.sjfisher.com 
</code>
  <p>This is will return</p>
<code>
  {"shorturl": " d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e " }
  </code>
  <p>Please note that in the free tier (the defaut) the <b>Shorturl</b> has been converted into an Md5 hash and that value is returned</p>
  <p>To access the short url use:</p>
<code>
    https://url.sjfisher.com?steve if on an elevated tier (email me for this) or https://url.sjfisher.com?d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e if not
</code>
<p>Note: the d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e is the Md5 hash of steve and you will need to use the Md5 value returned for you</p>
  
<p>Outside of the <b>From</b> and <b>To</b> date and time periods the <b>Defaulturl</b> URL will be the redirect target. The <b>Shorturl</b> URL will only active within the To and From period</p>

<p>I have set a limit per email address of 100 record or updates</p>
<p>As there is a uniqueness test on the short url (even if it is turned into the Md5 hash) you may get an error response if it isn't unique.</p>
<p>There is also a profanity filter on the short url</p>
<p>Keys have a life of about a month but when expired you can request another as shown above</p>
<p>For the free tier the live duration of a record you have addeded is also one month, this can be changed if you ask for elevated rights</p>
<p></p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: As a free service there are no warranties produced and the service can be discontinued at any time</p>
<p>Personal data protection policy - I won't use your personal data (your email and URLs) for any reason other than to provide this service. The data is held encrypted in a Cloud SaaS database.</p>
<p>You can immediately delete your URL records by updating them with a From and To date in the past or leave them for a month after the To date to automtically be deleted<p>
<p>You can update your URL records in the same way as you created them, and apart from the Shorturl field any of the others can be changed</p>
<p>Your API Key will be automatically deleted 30 days after it was created</p>
<p>As an enhancement I will add a data cleanup endpoint in the future</p>
